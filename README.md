# CSCI-2540
CSCI 2540 is a continuation of CSCI 2530, and a more advanced and intuitive course on Data Structures & Algorithms.
This course advanced from a structural style of computer programming to one that has a heavy dependence on objects and classes.
Furthermore, this course introduced the concepts of data abstraction and object-oriented programming.

# Background Information & Purpose
This repository represents the coursework (programming assigments) that I have completed throughout CSCI 2540.
This repository includes several folders, which are intended to showcase basic fundamental programming concepts along with
my familiarity of common data structures, data abstraction, and an object-oriented approach to computer programming.

All coursework is completed in Java using the Eclipse IDE.
    
# Lasting Note

as educational material to those whom may seek it. I am not responsible for, nor
do I condone academic plagiarism conducted from the material / source code found
