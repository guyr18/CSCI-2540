# CSCI-2540
# Assignment 5
Assignment 5 gave students practice with binary search trees. Several of the files in this assignment were implementations  
that can be found in 

  Data Structures and Abstractions with Java, Fifth Edition, with Timothy M. Henry. Pearson Education, 2019.
  
This assignment required us to implement inserting, searching, deleting and filtering of java objects by using
a binary search tree. These java objects were read in from a text file and then the before-mentioned functionality
was implemented through a standard console input menu.
